Rather than providing a fixed linear time-invariant controller, this approach yields a controller whoes parameters change with time. This controller typically consists of a linear time-invariant compensator together with a tuning mechanism which adjusts the controller gains; typical control objectives are stabilization and tracking.The bulk of the course will be centered on an identifier based approach. Here one chooses a model for the plant, whose parameters are unknown, and the plant parameters are recursively estimated; controller gains are computed assuming that the present estimate is corrent. We first study algorithms to carry out parameter estimation, we then look at various control laws, and finally these are combined to yield an adaptive controller.

Numerical techniques including finite difference, finite element, and particle tracking methods are studied and applied to the solution of problems in groundwater flow, aquifer mechanics, flownet generation, and advective-dispersive transport. Proper modelling approaches, error analysis, stability, discretization constraints, pitfalls, and model misuse are discussed. Students will be developing some of their own groundwater models, and will be obtaining hands-on experience with state-of-the-art interactive groundwater models in the PC laboratory.

Qualitative methods attempt to interpret meaning as opposed to purely measuring phenomena.  The focus of qualitative research is not descriptive measurement and prediction of phenomena, as offered by statistical description/analysis, but is more attuned to examining subjective understandings and the interpretation of meaning (hermeneutics).  This course will examine and evaluate the range of research tools comprising qualitative methods including: various interviewing methods, participant observation, ethnography, case study methods and dicourse analysis.  It will also engage with the theoretical debates and philosophical approaches that underpin qualitative research.",

It examines resistance to foreign invaders in Europe, the century of rebellion in Mexico in 1810-1917, anti-colonial wars of national liberation, Marxist revolutionary movements in South-East Asia and Latin America, the upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism and urban guerrilla warfare.  The course will focus on the sources of insurgencies, their nature and the support they drew from various social groups.  In each case, the government's response will also be investigated.  We will analyse theories of guerrilla thinkers and pacification models and pay particular attention to the gap between intended and actual policies, and the plight of civilians caught in crossfire.",

The types of time-series models include stationary auto regressive moving average (ARMA), nonstationary, special families of seasonal, transfer function-noise (multiple inputs-single output), intervention, and multivariate (multiple inputs-multiple output) models. Applications are used for explaining how the foregoing models are fitted to both natural and socio-economic time series by following the identification, estimation and diagnostic check stages of model construction. Other topics include simulation in engineering design, forecasting in the operation of large-scale projects, and environmental impact assessment.",

We discuss Cognitive Work Analysis, Brunswick's' Lens Model, Goal Directed Task Analysis, Situation Awareness Oriented Design, Naturalistic Decision Making, Contextual Inquiry, Macro-cognitive Methods, Activity Theory, Concept Mapping, Cognitive Task Analysis, Social Network Analysis and their application to different types of human engineering problems.  Students in this course will learn multiple methods in cognitive engineering with an emphasis on knowing the differences in foundation, assumptions and appropriate application of the methods.  Students will be expected to apply the methods in a realistic research context, applying for ethics clearance and working with actual participants.  Examples of appropriate topics may include understanding how people work with complex or automated systems models. Finally this course discusses aspects of the current research environment in cognitive engineering, with the objective of developing successful future researchers in this area.",

Graph-theoretic methods are then used to systematically derive the kinematic and dynamic equations; the numeric solution of these equations provides a simulation of the system's motion. Topics include: review of kinematics, dynamics and graph theoretic (GT) methods; application to one-dimensional mechanical systems; GT representation of two-dimensional components and systems; formulation and solution of governing system equations; extension to three dimensional mechanical systems with flexible bodies and mechatronic components; application to kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanisms, robotic manipulators, vehicles and satellites.",

Beginning with the earliest shrines and cities that appear in the Middle East, the Far East, and India, and exploring settlements in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas up to the year 1000CE. This course examines the origins of sacred and civic architectures in the landscapes and environments in which they emerge, moving across continents to recognize patterns of life, concepts of order and conduct, symbols, rituals, and myths embodied in our building practices and settlement patterns. Analysis in this course foregrounds the relationships to the lands that inform cultures, the formation and movement of societies, their temporary and permanent constructions, looking at the ecological and social bearings of cities as spaces of power, sanctuary, and exchange.

The increasing influence of technology, and the power struggles around access to and extraction of the globe's resources. Topics considered include the birth of industrial nations driven by Enlightenment reason, science and the emancipative promise of political liberty, as well as the fall of that early idealism with the realities of capitalism, colonialism, racism, and the destruction of the natural environment.

Topics of discussion include passive heating and cooling, solar geometry, climate and meteorological influences, microclimate, site design, daylighting, active systems, embodied energy, sustainable rating systems, sustainable design philosophies such as cradle to cradle, biomimicry and design for disassembly. Energy-related issues will be addressed and energy-based software design programs will be introduced. Understanding the role of design in an energy efficient or passive solar building will be a central learning outcome. [Note: Field trip fee: $15. Offered: W]",

By the end of the course, students will be able to estimate a linear model and conduct accurate inference in cases where economic data violate the assumptions of the standard linear regression model.
