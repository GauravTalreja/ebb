Students in HIST 622 read the great microhistories including Davis'' The Return of Martin Guerre, LeRoy Ladurie''s Montaillou and Caranaval at Romans, Spence''s The Death of Woman Wang, Ginzburg''s Night Battles, and others.  Through these sources students acquire a deep understanding of the historiography surrounding this genre.
