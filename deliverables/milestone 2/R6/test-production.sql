Students in HIST 622 read the great microhistories including Davis'' The Return of Martin Guerre, LeRoy Ladurie''s Montaillou and Caranaval at Romans, Spence''s The Death of Woman Wang, Ginzburg''s Night Battles, and others.  Through these sources students acquire a deep understanding of the historiography surrounding this genre.

What does human alteration of river systems mean for the current and future state of river ecology, morphology, and hydrology? Can we find a way for rivers to provide functionality that satisfies the needs of both society and nature? This course provides students with the background and tools to take on these and other essential questions and challenges.', 'Prereq: Level at least 2B.
